# PYTHON QUIZ GAME

# Project Description

Hello! My name is Arnima, and this is my very first Python project. I created this project as part of my coursework at Masai School, in collaboration with IIT Mandi. The goal of this project is to practice the basic programming concepts I have learned, such as loops, conditionals, and user interaction.
This project is a Quiz Game where the user answers fun and tricky multiple-choice questions. It’s designed to be interactive and engaging while demonstrating my understanding of Python programming. I built this project with guidance from my Professor and by referring to YouTube videos for ideas.

# Features Implemented

Interactive User Input: The game begins by asking the user for their name and displays a personalized welcome message.

Multiple-Choice Questions: The game includes 5 questions, each with four answer options.

Immediate Feedback: After answering each question, the user is informed if their answer was correct or incorrect, along with the correct answer if needed.

Score Calculation: The game calculates and displays the user's score as a percentage at the end.

Console-Based Interface: All interactions happen in the terminal/console, making it simple and beginner-friendly.

# How to Run the Project

# About This Project

This project is a simple and fun way to practice basic Python programming. It demonstrates the use of:

Tuples to store questions, options, and answers.

Loops to iterate through the questions and options.

Conditionals to check the user’s answers.

Lists to store the user’s guesses.

I hope you enjoy playing my first project! It’s been an exciting journey for me, and I’ve learned a lot while building it. Feel free to share any feedback or suggestions to help me improve.
